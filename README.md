This is a rough ROUGH draft to a To-Do List project. 

The purpose of it was to get used to organizing code via modules and using webpacks. 

For future reference, creating a more organized / in depth pseudo code before starting would be very beneficial. I had run into problems with naming my modules as well as deciding where to put arrays and objects,

I would of liked to implement some form of JSON to this as well. This will likely be something I recreate again when I have a longer time frame.
